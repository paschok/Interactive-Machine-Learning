# Interactive-Machine-Learning
Exercises from the course Praktikum Interactive Machine Learning at University of Augsburg

## Commit rules:

1. Exercise #: the work done - what to do next / what is needed
2. README.md : update

-----
### All(mostly all) work is done in <i>exercise_notebook.ipynb</i> files
### Model or Weights files are not pushed here, because they take a lot of memory. More practical would be to run model urself and obtain needed weights.
### imgs-folder can be found in root directory. Paths to this folder in notebooks are outdated
